                            To play chess well it is important to be familiar with numerous chess openings (because your opponents will be!). What even more important is not to confuse similar lines and always play the right moves.

                            We observed that studying or playing (even a lot!) a chess opening doesn't necessarily lead to its memorization. It requires many iterations and has a tendency of slipping away as the time passes by.
